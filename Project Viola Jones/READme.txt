1. How to change the file path:
	Line 60(in extract_labels()): change to folder containing training faces
	Line 67(in extract_labels_test()): change to folder containing testing faces
	Line 546(in main()): change to folder containing training faces and non-faces respectively
	Line 585(in main()): change to folder containing testing faces and non-faces respectively
!!!!!!Attention: file path must use '/', '\' will cause the program unable to run!!!!!!
I didn't use all the features as they take too long. But my calculation should be right with the right parameters.
2. Run the code, THANKS
